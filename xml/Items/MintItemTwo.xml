<Name>The Fall of the Rebel Angels - Pieter Bruegel the Elder</Name>
<Description>The painting depicts Michael the Archangel casting Lucifer and his followers from Heaven. 
	Bruegel adopts many of Boschâ€™s motifs, but also differentiates himself by including a whole new imagery reflecting the knowledge of the day, for example. This work may have been commissioned by a member of the ruling Habsburg dynasty in Brussels.</Description>
